# Chat System Testing Guide

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Echo Configuration
- Fixed authentication header function issue
- Added dynamic token retrieval
- Improved connection status management

### 2. Channel Management
- Fixed race condition where channels were set up before conversations loaded
- Added proper channel tracking with activeChannels Set
- Implemented setupChannelForConversation for individual channel management
- Proper cleanup when deleting conversations

### 3. Message Flow
- Enhanced handleNewMessage with better error handling
- Added auto-read functionality for active conversations
- Improved toast notifications with null checks
- Better conversation sorting and updates

### 4. Backend Improvements
- Fixed conversation creation logic to handle user roles properly
- Maintained database transactions for consistency
- Proper error handling in controllers

### 5. Connection Monitoring
- Added Pusher connection event listeners
- Real-time connection status updates
- Error notifications for connection issues

## Testing Steps:

1. **Setup Test Users:**
   - Create two test accounts (User A and User B)
   - Login with both accounts in different browser tabs/windows

2. **Test Message Flow:**
   - User A starts conversation with User B
   - Check if conversation appears in both users' chat lists
   - Send messages from both sides
   - Verify real-time message delivery
   - Check read status updates

3. **Test File Attachments:**
   - Send messages with image/file attachments
   - Verify files are properly uploaded and displayed

4. **Test Connection Handling:**
   - Disconnect network and reconnect
   - Check if messages sync properly after reconnection
   - Verify error notifications appear/disappear

5. **Test Edge Cases:**
   - Send empty messages (should be prevented)
   - Send very long messages
   - Upload large files
   - Rapid message sending

## Configuration Notes:

- Make sure Laravel queues are running for broadcasting
- Pusher credentials should be configured in .env
- Broadcasting routes should be authenticated via Sanctum
- File upload limits configured properly

## Common Issues to Check:

1. **Token Authentication:** Verify JWT/Sanctum tokens are valid
2. **CORS Settings:** Check if frontend can communicate with backend
3. **Queue Workers:** Broadcasting requires queue workers to be running
4. **File Permissions:** Ensure storage directories are writable
5. **Network Configuration:** Check if Pusher can connect from your domain

## Debug Commands:

```bash
# Check queue workers
php artisan queue:work

# Clear caches
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear

# Check broadcasting
php artisan tinker
broadcast(new App\Events\MessageSent($message, $user));
```
