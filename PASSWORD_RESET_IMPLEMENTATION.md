}
```

## 🎨 Frontend Routes

- `/forgot-password` - Enter email to receive reset code
- `/reset-password` - Enter OTP and new password
- `/verify-email` - Verify email during registration

## 🗄 Database Schema

### OTPs Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE otps (
  id BIGINT UNSIGNED PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  otp_code VARCHAR(4) NOT NULL,
  type ENUM('email_verification', 'password_reset') NOT NULL,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  is_used BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP,
  INDEX idx_email_type_used (email, type, is_used)
);
```

### Users Table (Updated)
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

## 🔧 Configuration Required

### Environment Variables
Add to your `.env` file:
```env
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your@email.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Your App Name"
```

### SendGrid Setup
1. Create SendGrid account
2. Verify sender email
3. Create API key with Mail Send permissions
4. Add configuration to environment

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **OTP Expiration**: Short expiration times prevent abuse
2. **Single Use**: OTPs can only be used once
3. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for OTP requests
4. **Email Validation**: Proper email format validation
5. **Token Revocation**: All tokens revoked after password reset
6. **Input Sanitization**: All inputs are validated and sanitized

## 📱 User Experience Flow

### Registration Flow
1. User fills registration form
2. System sends OTP to email
3. User enters OTP on verification page
4. Email is verified and account is created
5. User is automatically logged in

### Password Reset Flow
1. User clicks "Forgot Password" on login page
2. User enters email address
3. System sends OTP to email
4. User enters OTP and new password
5. Password is reset and user can login

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Test registration with email verification
2. Test password reset flow
3. Test OTP expiration
4. Test invalid OTP handling
5. Test email validation

### Email Testing in Development
Set `MAIL_MAILER=log` in `.env` to log emails instead of sending them.
Check `storage/logs/laravel.log` for email content.

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

1. Ensure SendGrid API key is configured
2. Verify sender email in SendGrid
3. Set up proper DNS records for your domain
4. Monitor SendGrid usage and quotas
5. Set up error monitoring for email failures

## 📞 Support
